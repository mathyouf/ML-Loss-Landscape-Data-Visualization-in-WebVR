    <header><h1>hello tensor flow</h1></header>
    
    <p>This is the basic <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/fit-curve.html">fit a curve to synthetic data</a>
      example from <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, but with different words, slightly different code
      and prettier graphs.</p>
    
    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>The premise of every <b>machine learning</b> problem is:
      <ul>
        <li>Someone gives us some data that was generated according to a <b>secret</b> formula. This data could be a bunch 
          of points (that are generated based on some math equation), but could also be fun, like images (the secret 
          formula could be "all of these dogs are golden retrievers") or sounds ("all of these sounds are made by a bird")</li>
        <li>By looking at this data we were given, we have to figure out how it was generated, so that we can correctly predict
          a future data point. For example, if we're given a photo, we can say whether it's a golden retriever, or if we
          are given a sound, we can tell if it was made by a bird.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>This specific example follows that pattern: we are given a bunch of data points according to a cubic polynomial (
      i.e. generated from <code>y = a * x ^ 3 + b * x^2 + c * x + d</code>), but hasn't told us the values of these <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients.
      Our goal is to learn these coefficients, so that if we're given a new <code>x</code>, we can say what the <code>y</code> should be.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The solution</h2>
    <p>
      Most machine learning algorithms follow this pattern:
      <ul>
        <li>We use that data we were given </li>
        <li>By looking at this data we were given, we have to figure out how it was generated, so that we can correctly predict
          a future data point. For example, if we're given a photo, we can say whether it's a golden retriever, or if we
          are given a sound, we can tell if it was made by a bird.</li>
      </ul>
