      <b>Machine Learning (ML) </b> is the dope new thing that everyone's talking about, because it's really good 
      at learning from data so that it can predict similar things in the future. Doing ML by hand is pretty annoying
      since it usually involves matrix math which is zero fun in JavaScript (or if you ask me: anywhere ðŸ˜…). 
      Thankfully, <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a> is here to help! It's 
      an open source library that has a lot of built-in Machine Learning-y things like models and algorithms so that 
      you don't have to write them from scratch.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Is your problem a Machine Learning problem?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is good at classifying and labelling data. The premise of every machine learning problem is:
      <ul>
        <li>Someone gives us some data that was generated according to a <b>secret</b> formula. This data could be a bunch 
          of points (that are generated based on some math equation), but could also be fun, like images (the secret 
          formula could be "some of these images are chihuahuas and some are <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/03/10/dog-or-muffin-meme/#LjBd4.e9lgqJ">
          blueberry muffins</a>") or bus schedules.</li>
        <li>By looking at this data we were given, we approximate the secret formula so that we can correctly predict
          a future data point. For example, if we're given a photo, we will eventually be able to confidently say whether it's a dog or a muffin.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
         
    <h2 id="demo">A fun demo!!</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to get started, predicting numbers tends to be easier than predicting images, so in this example
      we're trying to fit a curve to a bunch of data (this is the same example from the 
      <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/fit-curve.html">TensorFlow</a> site but with waaaaay more
      code comments and a prettier graph). 
      <br><br>
      We are given a bunch of points (the secret formula is <code>y = a * x ^ 3 + b * x^2 + c * x + d</code>), but we don't know the the values of those <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients.
      Our goal is to learn these coefficients, so that if we're given a new <code>x</code> value, we can say what the <code>y</code> 
      value should be.</p>
      
    <p>
      The <b>blue</b> dots are the training points we were given. The <b>red</b> dots would be our guesses,
      based on our initial, default coefficients (hella incorrect!). Once you click the <code>train</code>
      button, the <b>green</b> dots show how our coefficients are getting better. After you see the default
      example, check what happens if we are given fewer data points or fewer iterations!
    </p>
    
    <div class="input-container">
      <label for="points">initial points</label>
      <input id="points" placeholder="100" value="100" type="number" onchange="init()">
    </div>
    <div class="input-container">
      <label for="iterations">iterations</label>
      <input id="iterations" placeholder="75" value="75" type="number">
    </div>
    <button onclick="doALearning()">Learn!</button>

    <div id="graph"></div>
    
    <h2>How this works</h2>
      <p>
        Most machine learning algorithms follow this pattern:
        <ol>
          <li>We have to figure out the <b>"features"</b> of the secret formula that generated the data we were given, so that we 
          can learn them. In this example, those features are the coefficients in the polynomial. For something more 
          complex like the "is this dog a blueberry muffin" problem, we'd have to look at pixels and colours and formations. </li>
          <li>Once we figure out these features (in our case, those <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients), we initialize them to some 
            random values. We could now use them to make 
          predictions, but they would be teeeeeerrible because they're just random.</li>
          <li>(I'm just going to use our actual example from now on and 
          not dogs)</li>
          <li>We start looking at every piece of <code>(x,y)</code> data point we were given. We take the <code>x</code> and based on
            these default coefficients we have created, we predict what the <code>y</code> would be. We then look at the correct 
            <code>y</code> value from the data set we were given, calculate our error, and then adjust our coefficients so that our value would be closer
            to the actual one. This part is the most complicated one, and TensorFlow does this for us!</li>
          <li>We keep doing this until we use up all the data, and then repeat the entire process a bunch of iterations; at the 
          end if we had enough data, we've pretty much learnt the coefficients!</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

    <p>I commented basically every line of the code with what the algorithm or TensorFlow is doing (especially when
      TensorFlow is actually doing a looooot of heavy lifting behind the scenes). I hope it helps!</p>
