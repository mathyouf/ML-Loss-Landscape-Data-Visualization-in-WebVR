    <header><h1>hello tensor flow <div class="glitchButton"></div></h1></header>
    
    <p>This is the basic <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/fit-curve.html">fit a curve to synthetic data</a>
      example from <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, but with different words, slightly different code
      and prettier graphs. You can <a href="#demo">skip ahead to the demo</a> if you don't care about how it works.</p>
    
    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>The premise of every <b>machine learning</b> problem is:
      <ul>
        <li>Someone gives us some data that was generated according to a <b>secret</b> formula. This data could be a bunch 
          of points (that are generated based on some math equation), but could also be fun, like images (the secret 
          formula could be "all of these dogs are golden retrievers") or sounds ("all of these sounds are made by a bird")</li>
        <li>By looking at this data we were given, we have to figure out how it was generated, so that we can correctly predict
          a future data point. For example, if we're given a photo, we can say whether it's a golden retriever, or if we
          are given a sound, we can tell if it was made by a bird.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>This specific example follows that pattern: we are given a bunch of data points according to a cubic polynomial (
      i.e. generated from <code>y = a * x ^ 3 + b * x^2 + c * x + d</code>), but hasn't told us the values of these <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients.
      Our goal is to learn these coefficients, so that if we're given a new <code>x</code>, we can say what the <code>y</code> should be.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The solution</h2>
    <p>
      Most machine learning algorithms follow this pattern.
      <ol>
        <li>We have to figure out the <b>"features"</b> of the secret formula that generated the data we were given, so that we 
        can learn them. For our example, those features are the coefficients in the polynomial. For something more 
        complex like the "is this dog a golden retriever" problem, we'd have to look at pixels and colours and formations. </li>
        <li>Once we figure out these features (in our case, those <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients), we initialize them to some 
          random values. We could now use them to make 
        predictions, but they would be teeeeeerrible because they're just random.</li>
        <li>(I'm just going to use our actual example from now on and 
        not dogs)</li>
        <li>We start looking at every piece of <code>(x,y)</code> data point we were given. We take the <code>x</code> and based on
          these default coefficients we have created, we predict what the <code>y</code> would be. WE then look at the correct 
          <code>y</code> from the data point, calculate our error, and then adjust our coefficients so that our value would be closer
          to the actual one. This part is the most important one and TensorFlow does this for us</li>
        <li>We keep doing this for every data point we have, and repeat the entire process a bunch of iterations, and at the 
        end we've pretty much learnt the coefficients!</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
         
    <h2 id="demo">The fun demo</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>blue</b> dots are the training points we were given. The <b>red</b> dots would be our guesses,
      based on our initial, default coefficients (hella incorrect!). Once you click the <code>train</code>
      button, the <b>green</b> dots show how our coefficients are getting better. Check what happens if we
      are given fewer data points or fewer iterations!
